## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   ### Visitor Goals

        1. As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the destination Santorini.
        2. As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a user, I want to look for information relevant to Santorini that could help aid a prospective visitor/traveller to the island. Both in the form of recommendations and other dedicated Santorini travel sites, in the social media links.
	
    -   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are black, white and [Greek flag] blue, in the footer social links. Keeping the colour scheme simple, yet effective.
    -   #### Typography
        -   I opted to use the default Bootstrap font Apple System, due to itâ€™s clean font style, which fitted in with the aesthetic I wanted for the website.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Strong imagery has been proven to help engage the user. Enticing images were used in the map's info windows, to help with a positive UX.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### User Stories

    1. As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the destination Santorini.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable header, with the text 'Explore Santorini'. Underneath there is a small paragraph outlining the intention, recommendations for the island of Santorini, Greece. 
        2. A map of Santorini, Greece is presented below the text to allow the user to engage with the map, search bar, marker icons and info window boxes.

    2. As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The website was designed with the intention to be easy, simple to use and the content to be pretty self explanatory.
        2. Interactively via the map, three categories under the headings of attractions, restaurants and places to stay. Clearly displayed and marked under different universal logo/images and colour coded, with info window boxes displaying images of said recommendations and a link to learn more.

    3. As a user, I want to look for information relevant to Santorini that could help aid a prospective visitor/traveller to the island. Both in the form of recommendations and other dedicated Santorini travel sites, in the social media links.

        1. The integrated search bar embedded in the map section allows the user to search for other related destinations [attractions, restaurants & hotels], within Santorini and Greece.
        2. The social media links in the footer, reinforces additional content and information for Santorini, allowing the user to broaden their knowledge about the island.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad, iPhone 5SE, Samsung Galaxy S10 and all mobile device options provided by Google Chrome DevTools.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Manual Testing

Using the Bootstrap layout and mobile fist development method, it allowed me to create a responsive website. All of the content resizes appropriately within the size of the displayed screen. This was tested using Google Chrome DevTools, allowing me to use the responsive feature and set mobile devices, to resize the screen and see how the website responded to different device screen sizes. 

1. Map:
    1. Map loads centred on Santorini, Greece.
    2. Customised marker icons, image and colour coded to allow easability and functionality for the user.
    3. Info windows appear, one at a time, when the user clicks on the relevant marker.
    4. Additional information is provided with a link, to learn more about said recommendation. Reinforced with a strong image of the destination.
    5. Search bar enables the user to search for further destinations within Santorini and Greece.
    6. Drop down list which includes both places and predicted search terms.
    7. Once selected, a red marker highlights said destination and pins it to the centre of the map.
    8. Included functionally provided within Google Maps, scrolling function, with toggle fullscreen view, Google logo [opens new window, within Google Maps], drag pegman on to the map to open street view and zoom in & zoom out buttons. 
    9. No console errors detected.
    
2. Social Links:
    1. Social link icons load correctly at the footer of the website.
    2. Simple black social link icons, to fit in with the rest of the page. Hover colour chosen was blue from the Greek flag.
    3. Once the user clicks on the relevant icon, a new tab opens displaying said content.
    4. Either Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube.
    5. All social links are dedicated Santorini travel websites. 
    6. No console errors detected.

### Known Bugs

-   Places Search Box - When the user searches for a place and selects from the predicted search terms and either clicks with their mouse or selects via touch screen on mobile devices. The map will seem unresponsive. However when prompted again it works as intended. 

- When the same process is ended with the user pressing the enter button to action, or selecting via the keyboard arrows, the website is responsive, as intended. After following this query up with Code Institute's Tutor Support team, they informed me that they had not encountered this issue before. After checking through the JavaScript, they concluded that it was a glitch within Google Maps.

## Deployment
